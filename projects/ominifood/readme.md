# Welcome to the Omnifood Project

### This website was done as the last project of the HTML/CSS course of Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann, available on Udemy.

## Check here the _[final result](https://omnifood-andersonfpcorrea.netlify.app/)_

The main idea of this project was to create a responsive website to a tech company
whose main goal was selling a "food order subscription" service.

The layout, typefaces, copy and colors were selected based on the expected clients and the personality of the company.
